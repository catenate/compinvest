nb water commodity value increase price desalinate
Water shortages will become more acute as the population rises, offset
by wider adoption of water pressure and reclamation technologies,
government water-use bans, lower-cost water distribution networks,
and people messing with the weather to produce more rainfall.
Eventually, the commodity of freshwater will rise in price to be equal
to the cost to desalinate it, which price will lower as the efficiency
of the technology increases, cost of energy lowers, and prevalence of
desalination plants increases.  Once it reaches this price, it will
plateau until we drain the oceans of easily accessible salt water.
On the bright side, this use could offset any global rise in ocean
levels brought about by melting ice.

Since water will rise in price, a long position would be to acquire
water rights, stock in desalination companies, and actual water now,
and sell them (much) later, as their value increases.

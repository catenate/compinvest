As a slightly more complicated real-life example, the average height
for adult men in the United States is about 70 in, with a standard
deviation of around 3 in.  This means that most men (about 68 percent,
assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3 in of the mean
(67–73 in)—one standard deviation—and almost all men (about 95%)
have a height within 6 in of the mean (64–76 in)—two standard
deviations.  If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would
be exactly 70 in tall.  If the standard deviation were 20 in, then men
would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about
50–90 in.  Three standard deviations account for 99.7 percent of the
sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is normal
(bell-shaped).
